## StatusNet service ##
StatusNet ''service'' is currently in private beta.

## StatusNet software ##
StatusNet ''software'' is helping foster a more open internet experience. StatusNet is federated, meaning it pushes out and accepts notices through [OMB](http://openmicroblogging.org/), and also allows for remote subscription to and from other sites that speak the protocol. Through plugins, StatusNet is able to integrate with the ever popular twitter and facebook. The StatusNet software uses the same [API as twitter](http://apiwiki.twitter.com/), allowing it to use the same apps as twitter and bridge notices to twitter (a fully bi-directional twitter bridge that can pull notices does exist in the code, but may not yet be enabled on identi.ca)

To get a feeling for the status.net software, check out some sites with their different looks and feels. StatusNet's plugin architecture allows it to offer differing functionality, and through themes and [[Apps|clients]], different user experiences. StatusNet lets people share and connect. We love the diversity of uses StatusNet has fostered and the people it has inspired. This is an exciting time and development has been steaming along. Come join the fun by hacking, running or using the StatusNet software.
